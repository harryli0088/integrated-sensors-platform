    <p><b>Abstract.</b> Human performance measurement for computer-based tasks
      is a critical need for assessing new capabilities and making inferences
      about their usability, utility and efficacy. Currently, many performancebased assessments
      rely on outcome-based measures and subjective evaluations. However, a quantitative method
      is needed to provide more finegrained insight into performance.
      While there are some commercial solutions that integrate human sensors, in our exploration, these solutions
      have numerous limitations. We decided to build our own web application platform, the Integrated Sensors Platform (ISP),
      to collect, integrate, and fuse disparate human-based sensors, allowing users to link
      physio-behavioral outcomes to overall performance. Currently, we have
      integrated three sensors, two commercial and one custom, which together
      can help calculate various user metrics. While our focus has been using
      ISP to assess visualizations for cybersecurity, we hypothesize that it can
      have impact for both researchers and practitioners in the HCII community.</p>
